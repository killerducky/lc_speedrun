# lc_speedrun

Inspired by https://www.twitch.tv/clsmith15

Move all pieces to all squares using the least in-game time possible.
To prevent incentives to throw games, the code assigns the full game time for all losses.

Running:
edit lc_speedrun.ini
python3 lc_speedrun.py

Output:
Prints to stdout stats for each game, and final boards in ASCII.
Also writes P, N, B, Q, K.svg files for final boards.
